Abu: A scripting language for Hadoop
=====================================
Abu is a language that helps in writing Hadoop map reduce jobs by extracting out the essence of the map reduce logic into a DSL.
Scripts written in the abu DSL can then be:
    - "compiled" into standard java boilerplate to be run on hadoop
    - visualized using Graphviz
    
Abu achieves both goals by generating text - java in the case of "compile" and graphviz source files (in dot format) in the case of "visualize"; so its less of a true DSL, and more of a code generator. However, it helps to think of it in terms of a scripting language as the expectation is that you'd spend most of your "map reduce logic and flow planning" time in abu rather than in java boilerplate land.

Abu does require you to know about Hadoop, and actually is intended as a learning tool for Hadoop; not a replacement. It in fact started as a personal attempt at grokking map reduce at a high level while learning Hadoop. Abu is not turing complete and doesnt allow definition of the actual map and reduce functions themselves - just their interface contracts and how they combine with each other. Abu output will therefore contain skeletons of the map and reduce functions, and you will still have to fill them in.

Having said that, its conceivable that some point in the future it does allow such definition, specifically via the (J)Ruby syntax.How this will actually work - TBD

Goals:
======
- no boilerplate, just the core logic
- still looks like map reduce, ie, not high level like Pig
- can generate boilerplate on request
- generate dot format output so that it can be easily visualized
- analyses i/o and ensures correctness at dsl level

- repl? dont know yet

Sample scripts[Design]:
======================
1. Simple job:

job job1:
    read    (k1:type,v1:type) from "/path/to/file.ext"  using DataReaderClassName
    map     (k1:type,v1:type) to    (k2:type,v2:type)   using mapClassname 
    reduce  (k2:type,v2:type) to    (k2:type,v2:type)   using redClassname
    write   (k3:type,v3:type) to    "/path/to/file.ext"     using DataWriterClassName

2. Simple job with mapred abstracted out and named:
job job1:
    read    (k1:type,v1:type) from "/path/to/file.ext"  using DataReaderClassName
    mr1 (k1:type,v1:type) to    (k3:type,v3:type)
    write   (k3:type,v3:type) to    "/path/to/file.ext"     using DataWriterClassName

mapreduce mr1:
    map     (k1:type,v1:type) to    (k2:type,v2:type)   using mapClassname 
    reduce  (k2:type,v2:type) to    (k2:type,v2:type)   using redClassname

3. Chained job:

job job1:
    read    (k1:type,v1:type) from "/path/to/file.ext"  using DataReaderClassName
    mr1 (k1:type,v1:type) to    (k3:type,v3:type)
    mr2 (k3:type,v3:type) to    (k5:type,v5:type)
    write   (k5:type,v5:type) to    "/path/to/file.ext"     using DataWriterClassName
// mr1 same as before
mapreduce mr2:
    map     (k3:type,v3:type) to    (k4:type,v4:type)   using mapClassname 
    reduce  (k4:type,v4:type) to    (k5:type,v5:type)   using redClassname

4. mapred defn with optional reducer:
mapreduce mr34:
    map     (k3:type,v3:type) to    (k4:type,v4:type)   using mapClassname 

5. mapred defn with optional mapper:
mapreduce mr43:
    reduce  (k4:type,v4:type) to    (k5:type,v5:type)   using redClassname

6. Tuple definitions: 
    - Dont care value in tuple: (_, field2, field 3)
    - List of objects of a type: [type] or [var] where var of type 'type'

Roadmap:
========
Milestone 1 (v 0.1):
    - build parser: Basic parser done. Recognizes the keyword and basic structure expected.
Milestone 2 (v 0.2):
    - build (j)ruby parser + generator + visualizer (no validation or 'smarts')
    - make it shebang runnable and evaluate making a maven plugin/ant task
    - refactor code to make it better/DRY
    - revalutate including java "trapdoors" per feedback from CHUG session
Milestone 3 (v 0.3):
    - build java code generator
    - build java visualizer
    - make it workflow ready (See http://kdpeterson.net/blog/2009/11/hadoop-workflow-tools-survey.html for a nice set of requirements)
        - provide a wrapper for existing hadoop jobs to be expressed in abu: the migration path
Milestone 4:
    - evaluate jruby implementation of full scripting language.
    - decide on which of two versions to continue, or if both should.
Milestone 5 (v 0.4):
    - build analyzer (aka 'smarts' and/or validation). This is where the tuple definitions mentioned in Design #6 would matter.
Milestone 6:
    - Test out on at least 10 basic samples from the Hadoop Definitive Guide or Hadoop in Action, generate code and viz
    - add sanity tests
Milestone 7 (v 1.0):
    - Validate (j)ruby version and release.
Milestone 8 (v 1.1):
    - Validate java version and release

Ideas for future features:
=========================
- ability to include scripts
- ability to have "dont care" values for keys and/or values. Came accross this when evaluating the log processing scenario, but more analysis tbd

About the name
==============
I first intended to name this tool Ankush - the sanskrit name for the tool that real mahouts use to control elephants, especially as it made sense to me - this was a tool to help me understand and control the hadoop elephant. Another thought was to name it using the Doug Cutting Method(TM) - by asking my kids for one. That backfired because I couldnt get anything coherent (or sufficiently cute) even out of my 3.5 yr old. 
So I started looking at elephants that kids knew about. Dumbo seemed somehow inappropriate, but Abu the monkey-turned-elephant from Alladin seemed to fit. So there you go :)
