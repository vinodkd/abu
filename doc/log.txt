10/23/2010: Starting log as this seems useful to explain changes chronologically
10/23/2010: Feedback from Chug 1021:
                - see how abu could be integrated with workflow engines for it to fully serve the purpose of a hadoop dsl
                - make it a maven plugin so that viz could be integrated into the CI workflow
                - keep the "java trapdoor" ie, the ability to drop down into the raw java code because that does make sense in a production scenario
            Changing roadmap accordingly
10/25/2010: Working on using modules right.
