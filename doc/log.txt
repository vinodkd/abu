10/23/2010: Starting log as this seems useful to explain changes chronologically
10/23/2010: Feedback from Chug 1021:
                - see how abu could be integrated with workflow engines for it to fully serve the purpose of a hadoop dsl
                - make it a maven plugin so that viz could be integrated into the CI workflow
                - keep the "java trapdoor" ie, the ability to drop down into the raw java code because that does make sense in a production scenario
            Changing roadmap accordingly
10/25/2010: Working on using modules right. 
10/26/2010: Tried to get jruby to run; couldnt. Have forgotten how it worked before. jabu script has been created, but jruby is not running by itself either. TODO
10/26/2010: was trying to move to erb for the templates, and reading about binding. Will need this to execute the templates in the context of the command being output.
            - also need to find a way to have the templates as separate files instead of in the code.
10/27/2010: All of this so that erb would allow for the templates to represent actual variable names instead of args0[xx].But that array is built from mutiple objects,
            and not sure if its worth doing it now.
            Larger refactor: Make pluggable templates, ie each command could have more than one gen and viz templates, that can be chosen on the fly. currently only
            one template is supported.
10/27/20107:05 AM : almost at end of erb conversion. wierdly only one template - viz-block-bottom requires escaped quotes. pending to be converted: all the link templates
            then save it, remove binding arg , save again, then move apply_template to templates.rb
10/27/20107:11 AM: btw jruby is working now. problem turned out to be inclusion of a windows path in the classpath. removing qtjava.zip from classpath did the trick
10/27/20109:16 AM: found reason for block_bottom not working: was still using ruby templates, not erb
10/27/20105:01 PM: need to organize docs a bit. Idea.txt has the core idea, roadmap, some design and the colophon. Design.txt has some design discussion.
                readme.markdown has a bit of the idea, a how to guide, a sample, and the colophon.
                I should do the following:
                    - readme.markdown will be the front page and point to the others.
                    - keep Idea.txt to the original idea and colophon. Any new pie-in-the-sky ideas will be added here.
                    - Move all design to design.txt
                    - create a new roadmap file
                    - create a new howto guide
